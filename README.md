<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Nathaniel Afrifah-Adae!👨🏾‍💻</h1>
<h5 align="center">As a candidate who has transitioned from mechanical engineering to now data, I’ve carried my transferrable skills with me. I love using Python & SQL to analyse data trends. My love for football makes it easy to understand collaboration and succeeding in smaller roles as part of a bigger project. With previous experience in Concessions, I have demonstrated leadership achieving outstanding results wherever I’ve been. I am more than ready to contribute to success. 
Looking to begin work with no notice period in an analyst or engineer role, open to remote or hybrid working.</h5>

- ⚡ Fun fact **A day on Venus (rotation on its axis) is longer than a year on Venus (orbit around the Sun). Venus rotates extremely slowly, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, while it only takes about 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the Sun!** 🌍
